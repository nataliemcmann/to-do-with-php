# Mac Installation

On Mac OS Big Sur, install [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/) in the terminal. Then use Homebrew to install PHP by running `brew install php`. 

# Running the server
PHP comes with a default web server that can be starting with the command `php -S localhost:8000`. It works for simple pages, like the hello.php file, but will not work for bigger projects. For this project, I installed MAMP.

# About the hello.php file
This a small file that shows how html can be combined with php in a .php file to create a webpage. It does some cool things.
