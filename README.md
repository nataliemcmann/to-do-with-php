# to-do-with-php
A to do app made with php. 

# Mac Installation

On Mac OS Big Sur, install [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/) in the terminal. Then use Homebrew to install PHP by running `brew install php`. 

# Running the server
PHP comes with a default web server that can be starting with the command `php -S localhost:8000`. It works for simple pages, like the hello.php file, but will not work for bigger projects. For this project, I installed MAMP. 

# MAMP Installation

[MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) can be downloaded for free. It is an Apache server by default. Once downloaded and opened, the document root of the default localhost can be changed by going to MAMP preferences. 

# About the hello.php file
This a small file that shows how html can be combined with php in a .php file to create a webpage. It does some cool things.
